# applause

Applause is a basic DSL that allows for easy construction of [Clap] `App`s that
make use of subcommands.

It magicks away the endless `match`es and `enum`s to define subcommands,
arguments and handlers in favour of a simple dispatch system while passing as
much as possible back to `clap` via its `derive` API.
